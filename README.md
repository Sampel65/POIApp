# POI Finder App

This is a simple iOS application that displays points of interest (POIs) around a user’s current location using Apple Maps and the MapKit framework. The app allows users to:

- View their current location on an Apple Map.
- Search for nearby places (e.g., restaurants, cafes, gas stations) using Apple’s `MKLocalSearch` API.
- Select a place to see more details (e.g., name, category, address).
- Save favorite locations for offline access using CoreData.
